The workings for a very interesting exercise from the Econometrics of Financial Markets 
module of the MSc Quantitative Finance course at Bayes Business School (formerly Cass).

Excerpt from the paper:

In an intraday frequency setting, one possible measure of realised volatility is that of 
the squared return. In this study, all returns have been computed via the differencing of 
log prices to maintain their additive properties. Subsequently, the squared market returns 
can be summed to compute the desired frequency of realised volatility.

Namely, an 𝑛 period realised volatility can be computed by the summation of all 𝑚 period 
squared returns within the 𝑛 period.
